# How many Balloons
A string S consisting of uppercase English letters is given. In one move we can delete seven letters from S, forming the word "BALLOON" (one 'B', one 'A', two 'L's, two 'O's and one 'N'), and leave a shorter word in S. If the remaining letters in the shortened S are sufficient to allow another instance of the word "BALLOON" to be removed, next move can be done. What is the maximum number of such moves that we can apply to S?
